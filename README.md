# -Password generator-

## Description

The goal of the project was to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface.



- Includes prompted for the length of the password
- Includes prompted asked for character types to include in the password, whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
- When each prompt was answe, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
- When all prompts are answered, a password is generated.
- Unfortunately, I wasn't able to generate the password, but at least I was able to generate pop up windows with questions and generated random numbers, letters and special characters.
